Programming Assignment 2: N-Body Simulation


Please estimate the number of hours to complete this assignment:

About 6 hours

/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you receive help from classmates, past COS 126 students, or
 *  anyone else? If so, please list their names.  ("A Sunday lab TA"
 *  or "Office hours on Thursday" is ok if you don't know their name.)
 **********************************************************************/

Yes or no?

Yes, a Sunday Lab TA helped me finish a few issues I was having with my code.



/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you encounter any serious problems? If so, please describe.
 **********************************************************************/

Yes or no?

One issue I had was printing the output in the specified format,
but I was able to complete it eventually.
I went to the Lab TAs as well, which helped me solve some issues I
had regarding the net forces.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here.
 **********************************************************************/

It was interesting to create a program that had realistic use,
which is something that I am rarely able to do in a learning environment.
